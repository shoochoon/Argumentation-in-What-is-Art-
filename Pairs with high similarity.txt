154:Relation: ElaborationText 1: According to Ruge (1802-, a strict follower of Hegel, beauty is the Idea expressing itself.\nThe spirit, contemplating itself, either finds itself expressed completely, and then that full expression of itself is beauty; or incompletely, and then it feels the need to alter this imperfect expression of itself, and becomes creative art.Label 1: ['S']Text 2: According to Hegel (1770-, God manifests himself in nature and in art in the form of beauty.\nGod expresses himself in two ways: in the object and in the subject, in nature and in spirit.\nBeauty is the shining of the Idea through matter.\nOnly the soul, and what pertains to it, is truly beautiful; and therefore the beauty of nature is only the reflection of the natural beauty of the spirit—the beautiful has only a spiritual content.\nBut the spiritual must appear in sensuous form.\nThe sensuous manifestation of spirit is only appearance, and this appearance is the only reality of the beautiful.\nArt is thus the production of this appearance of the Idea, and is a means, together with religion and philosophy, of bringing to consciousness and of expressing the deepest problems of humanity and the highest truths of the spirit.\nTruth and beauty, according to Hegel, are one and the same thing; the difference being only that truth is the Idea itself as it exists in itself, and is thinkable.\nThe Idea, manifested externally, becomes to the apprehension not only true but beautiful.\nThe beautiful is the manifestation of the Idea.Label 2: ['S']Similarity:
